#TunrRT

TunrRT is the Windows Runtime app client for Tunr.io.

Currently this project is built for Windows Phone, but a universal app including desktop/tablet support is certainly a future possibility.

This app is a work in progress, and, at the time of writing, not even functional yet. Please be patient.
